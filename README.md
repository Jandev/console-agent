# Fibonacci Multi-Agent Workflow

This project demonstrates a declarative multi-agent workflow using the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework with an interactive conversational interface that can handle both Fibonacci-specific operations and general questions.

## Overview

The application implements three specialized AI agents that collaborate in an interactive chat environment:

1. **FibonacciGenerator**: Generates Fibonacci sequences and explains Fibonacci concepts
2. **FibonacciValidator**: Validates Fibonacci sequences for correctness
3. **GeneralAssistant**: Handles non-Fibonacci questions using the LLM's general knowledge

## Architecture

### Multi-Agent System

The system uses three specialized agents working together in an interactive chat environment:

- **FibonacciGenerator**: Generates Fibonacci sequences using kernel functions and explains Fibonacci concepts
- **FibonacciValidator**: Validates Fibonacci sequences for correctness and provides detailed feedback
- **GeneralAssistant**: Handles non-Fibonacci questions by leveraging the LLM model's general knowledge

The agents intelligently route questions to the appropriate specialist, creating a collaborative environment where each agent focuses on their area of expertise.

### Key Components

1. **FibonacciApp.cs**: Main application orchestrating the multi-agent conversational workflow
2. **FibonacciPlugin.cs**: Kernel plugin containing Fibonacci-related functions
3. **FibonacciAgentInstructions.cs**: Agent instruction definitions for all three agents
4. **FibonacciTerminationStrategy.cs**: Custom termination strategy for the agent group chat
5. **MockChatCompletionService.cs**: Mock chat completion service for demonstration
6. **fibonacci-agents.yaml**: Declarative YAML agent definitions (reference)

## Available Functions

### FibonacciPlugin Functions

- **GenerateFibonacci(count)**: Generates first N Fibonacci numbers
- **ValidateFibonacci(sequence)**: Validates a sequence for Fibonacci correctness
- **GetFibonacciString(count)**: Returns formatted string of Fibonacci numbers
- **IsFibonacciNumber(number)**: Checks if a number is a Fibonacci number

## Setup

### Azure OpenAI Configuration

Before running the application, you'll need to configure Azure OpenAI settings. See the [Azure OpenAI Setup Guide](./docs/AZURE_OPENAI_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions on:

- Setting up your Azure OpenAI service
- Configuring API keys and endpoints
- Updating the `appsettings.json` file

## Usage

1. Build and run the application:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

2. Choose option `2` for "Fibonacci Multi-Agent Workflow"

3. The application will start an interactive chat session where you can ask:
   - **Fibonacci questions**: "What are the first 10 Fibonacci numbers?"
   - **Validation questions**: "Is this sequence correct: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5?"
   - **Individual number checks**: "Is 89 a Fibonacci number?"
   - **General questions**: "What is machine learning?" or "Explain photosynthesis"
   - **Mixed questions**: Questions that involve both Fibonacci and general concepts

4. Type `exit` to quit the application

## Interactive Features

The application now provides a rich conversational experience with:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Ask questions in plain English
- **Context Awareness**: Agents understand the context and route questions appropriately
- **Multi-Domain Support**: Seamlessly switch between Fibonacci-specific and general topics
- **Agent Coordination**: Multiple agents can collaborate on complex questions
- **Visual Feedback**: Different emojis (ðŸ”¢, âœ…, ðŸ¤–) identify which agent is responding
- **Graceful Termination**: Intelligent conversation management that knows when to stop

## Example Interactions

### Fibonacci Sequence Generation

```text
You: What are the first 8 Fibonacci numbers?

FibonacciGenerator ðŸ”¢: The first 8 Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

Each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting with 0 and 1.
```

### Sequence Validation

```text
You: Is this sequence correct: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8?

FibonacciValidator âœ…: âœ… VALID: The sequence [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8] is a correct Fibonacci sequence.
This represents the first 7 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
```

### General Knowledge Questions

```text
You: What is the capital of France?

GeneralAssistant ðŸ¤–: The capital of France is Paris. It's located in the north-central part of France 
and is known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral.
```

### Agent Collaboration

```text
You: Is 21 a Fibonacci number and what comes after it?

FibonacciValidator âœ…: Yes, 21 is indeed a Fibonacci number! It's the 8th number in the sequence.

FibonacciGenerator ðŸ”¢: The number that comes after 21 in the Fibonacci sequence is 34 
(since 13 + 21 = 34). The sequence continues: ..., 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```

## Declarative Agent Definitions

The `fibonacci-agents.yaml` file demonstrates how these agents could be defined declaratively using YAML format, following the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework patterns:

```yaml
generator_agent:
  type: chat_completion_agent
  name: FibonacciGenerator
  description: Specialist agent for generating Fibonacci sequences
  instructions: |
    You are a Fibonacci sequence generator specialist...
  tools:
    - id: GenerateFibonacci
      type: function
      description: Generates the first N numbers of the Fibonacci sequence

validator_agent:
  type: chat_completion_agent
  name: FibonacciValidator
  description: Specialist agent for validating Fibonacci sequences
  instructions: |
    You are a Fibonacci sequence validation specialist...
  tools:
    - id: ValidateFibonacci
      type: function
      description: Validates if a sequence follows Fibonacci rules

general_agent:
  type: chat_completion_agent
  name: GeneralAssistant
  description: General-purpose assistant for non-Fibonacci questions
  instructions: |
    You are a helpful general assistant that can answer questions on any topic...
```
